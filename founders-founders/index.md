# FOUNDERS FOUNDERS

## WHAT IS IT?

[Founders Founders](http://www.founders-founders.com/) is a **peer-to-peer community** of entrepreneurs, companies, investors, partners, marketers, desingers,and engineers. It envolves more than 300 people from all over the world who want to **promote individual and business growth** through a context that empowers collaboration and mutual aid.

## HOW IT STARTED?

It was founded by 5 entrepreneurs who graduated from ([UPTEC](https://uptec.up.pt/)) incubator and realised that the city was lacking a place where market-validated, fast-growing companies could work together and share experiences. Founders Founders was created to satisfy these needs in 2016 and has been growing ever since.

## HOW IT FUNCTIONS?

A part of Founders Founders community is installed at the **Founders House, community’s physical home**. The House is located in the city center of Porto, Portugal in a beautiful office building with more than 1500m2 and is prepared to host more than 18 companies.

In the house there is also the Founders Café, a privileged place where the entrepreneurial community gathers and discusses innovate ideas and precious experiences. Besides that, the Founders Café is the place where all the community events happen - from four official monthly events dedicated to business (**Scale Me Up**), technology (**Tech Tech Talk**), networking (**Founders Are Happy [Hour]**), marketing and sales (**Let’s Grow Again**) to other one-time events related to entrepreneurial fields (Fireside Chats, Workshops among others).

Currently, Founders Founders houses 16 different start-ups, ([these in particular](http://www.founders-founders.com/residents/)) focused on areas such as digital marketing, retail, health and facility management. Together, all the Founders Founders’ resident companies have received more than **10 million euros in investment** and employ more than **160 people**.

## MY ROLE

As the **community and operations manager of Founders Founders** I was responsible for day-to-day operations of the community as well as for ensuring the well-being of all members. I managed the organization’s **communication, marketing, PR & sponsors, and also direct and coordinate events**. You can read all the newsletters I've written in this <a href="/blog">BLOG</a>.

Besides that, I was also responsible for the pre-selection, selection and on-boarding of the new resident scale-ups at Founders Founders.

I joined Founders Founders in June 2016 and the project has been growing ever since. When I joined the Founders Founders only had 8 resident start-ups, 80 resident members and around 150 people involved in the community. With time these numbers have grown and currently Founders Founders have **2 office locations in Porto, 1 in Lisbon and Barcelos**. It also has more than 300+ resident members and more than 600 people involved in the network.

I was also responisble for creating synergies and partnerships with other companies that would contribute towards the growth of our members as well as our project. 

My work also involved leading and implementing Founders Founders independent projects such as Founders TV’s vlog series, **Founder Meets Founder** and **Incinerator**, and one week event, **BOOM – Massive Growth Week**.

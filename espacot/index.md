# ESPAÇO T

## WHAT IS IT?

[Espaço T](http://www.espacot.pt/), Association for Support to Social and Community Integration, is an **association** that **fights exclusion and oppression**. Espaço T aims to create a reality where all the users (i.e. people with illness, physical and mental disabilities) are accepted and able to express themselves through different art activities.

## HOW IT STARTED?

Espaço T was founded in 1994 as the space that provides  **active, conscious and free social participation**. The name, **Espaço T**, has a special meaning since the letter "T" stands for **“todos (in portuguese)" or "all of us" (in english).** The name therefore symbolises an open space with no restriction, where all human beings are welcomed.

The work of Espaço T focuses on 2 main areas:

- The **individual framework of artistic, cultural and formation activities**  that stimulate user's expressive capabilities and self-consciousness. This area intends to change users’ attitudes, values and self-esteem.
- The **promotion and acceptance of social change** that foster long-lasting relationships and influence the users’ quality of life.

## HOW IT FUNCTIONS?

Espaço T’s daily operations consist of many **interrelated interventions** such as ateliers of artistic expression, psychological treatments, employment empowerment and integration sessions, formations, emergency support line, and many other initiatives that aim to open new opportunities to the association’s users. 

Espaço T has currently about **500 users** - these users face substance abuse problems,  HIV, Down's syndrome and other physical disabilities.

## MY ROLE

As an intern at Espaço T I was responsible for **conducting cultural initiatives and artistic workshops**. Besides that, I was responsible for the **development of social media and campaigns communication**. 

I managed to organise various activities alone - some of them focused on **learning a new language** and others focused on **improving the user’s motoric capabilities**. During this period I had to develop my own class preparation process, lead the activities and better understand the Portuguese social, education and health systems. 

While at Espaço T (7 months) I was also **promoting extra-program activities** among the users and their networks (e.g. families, friends), and also participated in fairs where I was **promoting Espaço T**.

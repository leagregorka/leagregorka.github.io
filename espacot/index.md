# ESPAÇO T

## WHAT IS IT?

[Espaço T](http://www.espacot.pt/), Association for Support to Social and Community Integration, is an **association** that was founded in 1994 to **fight exclusion and oppression**. Espaço T aims to create a reality where all their users (i.e. people with illness, physical or mental disabilities or people who simply want express themselves through art) can participate in different art activities that are organised and led by groups of health and arts professionals.

## HOW IT STARTED?

Espaço T Space started its activity with the objective to **provide an active, conscious and free social participation among their users**. The name, **Espaço T**, has a special meaning since **the letter "T" stands for “todos (in portuguese)" i.e. all of us** and represents an open space where there are no restriction, where all human beings are welcomed.

Espaço T’s work focuses on 2 main areas:

- The **individual framework of artistic, cultural and formation activities** (formal or non-formal) that stimulate the expressive capabilities and self-investment of its users. This area intends to change users’ attitudes, values and self-esteem.
- The **promotion and acceptance of social change** through Espaço T's culture. This area aims to foster long-lasting relationships that change the users’ quality of life.

## MY ROLE

As an **intern at Espaço T** I was responsible for **conducting cultural initiatives, artistic activities and workshops**. Besides that, I was also responsible for the **development of social media and campaigns communication**. 

I managed to organise various activities alone, some focused on **learning a new language** and others focused on **improving the user’s motoric capabilities**. During this period I had to develop my own class preparation process, lead the activities and better understand the Portuguese Social, Education and Health systems. 

While at Espaço T (7 months) I was also **promoting extra-program activities** among the users and their networks (e.g. families, friends). In addition, I participated in fairs and events where I was **promoting Espaço T’s iniciative**.

# INCINERATOR 

## WHAT IS IT?

[Incinerator](https://www.founders-founders.com/founderstv-incinerator/) is a **series of film documentaries** alongside real live events about **start-up failure**. It highlights the path and learnings of Portuguese startups that have already failed.

This project was the second production of FoundersTV that was supported by  [Câmara Municipal do Porto](http://www.cm-porto.pt/) and [ScaleUp Porto](http://scaleupporto.pt/).

## HOW IT FUNCTIONS?

The Incinerator series is composed of **6 independent short documentaries** where startup founders themselves explain their stories in depth and share with the public what went wrong and what they learnt in the process. 

The project aims to show that in a startup, nothing is lost and everything is transformed, as well as to make these valuable lessons accessible to everybody.

# FOUNDER MEETS FOUNDER

## WHAT IS IT?

[Founder Meets Founder](http://founders-founders.com/founderstv) is the **first ever production of FoundersTV**, an initiative that aims to boost the Portuguese entrepreneurship ecosystem thorugh valuable content.

It is a **talk show** where the two Porto’s scale-up founders discuss and explore each other’s professional journeys. The aim of the project is to **share the entrepreneurial knowledge and experiences**, as well as to **promote Porto’s scale-up ecosystem** internationally. 

The project was also supported by [Câmara Municipal do Porto](http://www.cm-porto.pt/) and [ScaleUp Porto](http://scaleupporto.pt/).

## HOW IT FUNCTIONS?

The first prodution fo the project consisted of 2 parts:

- **Serie of events**

We organised 6 independent events where **2 startup founders were speaking about their challenges** in front of an audience. The event itself started with the introduction of the project and the invited founders, and then continued with the  conversation between them (no moderation). After that a **networking session** followed as well. All the events attracted **more than 300 attendees**.

- **Final episodes**

After the live events implementations, the filming material was revised and the most pertinent parts were carefully chosen to then be edited into the final episode (20min). The first season of the talk show consists of **6 episodes** and each episode has a **different focus** - some are focused on investment, some on team, some on technology etc.

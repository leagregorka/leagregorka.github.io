# FOUNDERS MEETS FOUNDER

## WHAT IS IT?

[Founder Meets Founder](http://founders-founders.com/founderstv) is the first ever production of FoundersTV, an initiative created to boost the Portuguese entrepreneurship ecosystem.

It is a talk show where the two Porto’s scale-up founders discussed and explored each other’s professional journeys. The aim of the project was to share the entrepreneurial knowledge and experiences, as well as to promote the Porto’s scale-up ecosystem internationally. For that reason, the project was also supported by Câmara Municipal do Porto and ScaleUp Porto. With the implementation we have stimulated the entrepreneurial culture and represented a historical record of the experienced entrepreneurs’ work.

## HOW IT STARTED?

It was founded by 5 entrepreneurs who graduated from another incubator ([UPTEC](https://uptec.up.pt/)) and realised that the city was lacking a place where market-validated fast-growing companies could work together and share experiences. Founders Founders was therefore created to satisfy these needs in 2016 and has been growing ever since.

## HOW IT FUNCTIONS?

The project consisted of 2 parts:

- **An event**

We organised 6 independent event where the 2 founders were speaking about their challenges in front of an audience. The event itself started with the introduction of the invited founders and the explanation of the project and then continue with the actual conversation between them (meaning no moderation). After that a networking session followed as well. All the event attracted more than 300 attendees and each one of them had the duration of approximately 1.5h. Besides that, the whole event was filmed.

- **Final episodes**

After the live event implementation, the filming material was revised and the most pertinent parts carefully chosen to then be edited into the final episode (20min). The first season of the talk show consists of 6 episodes that were published on Founders Founders’ website, YouTube Channel and social networks. Each episode has a special and different focus, for example some are focused on investment challenges, some on team challenges, etc.

## MY ROLE

As the community manager of Founders Founders I’m responsible for day-to-day operations of the community ensuring the well-being of all Founders.

I joined Founders Founders in June 2016 and the project has been growing ever since. When I joined the Founders Founders only had 8 resident start-ups, 80 resident member and around 150 people involved in the community.

In short we can say I make sure that Founders Founders community provides the best conditions for its members and creates synergies between them to contribute towards their growth, every day.

My work also involves leading and implementing Founders Founders independent projects such as Founders TV’s first vlog series  - Founder Meets Founder, Founders Club and BOOM – Massive Growth Week.

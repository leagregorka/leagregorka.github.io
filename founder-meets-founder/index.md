# FOUNDERS MEETS FOUNDER

## WHAT IS IT?

[Founder Meets Founder](http://founders-founders.com/founderstv) is the **first ever production of FoundersTV**, an initiative that aims to boost the Portuguese entrepreneurship ecosystem.

It is a **talk show where the two Porto’s scale-up founders discussed and explored each other’s professional journeys**. The aim of the project was to **share the entrepreneurial knowledge and experiences**, as well as to **promote the Porto’s scale-up ecosystem** internationally. For that reason, the project was also supported by [Câmara Municipal do Porto](http://www.cm-porto.pt/) and [ScaleUp Porto](http://scaleupporto.pt/). With the implementation we have stimulated the entrepreneurial culture and represented a historical record of the experienced entrepreneurs’ work.

## HOW IT FUNCTIONS?

The project consisted of 2 parts:

- **An event**

We organised 6 independent event where the **2 founders were speaking about their challenges** in front of an audience. The event itself started with the introduction of the invited founders and the explanation of the project and then continue with the actual conversation between them (meaning no moderation). After that a **networking session** followed as well. All the event attracted **more than 300 attendees** and each one of them had the duration of approximately 1.5h. Besides that, the whole event was filmed.

- **Final episodes**

After the live event implementation, the filming material was revised and the most pertinent parts carefully chosen to then be edited into the final episode (20min). The first season of the talk show consists of **6 episodes** that were published on Founders Founders’ website, YouTube Channel and social networks. Each episode has a **special and different focus**, for example some are focused on investment challenges, some on team challenges, etc.

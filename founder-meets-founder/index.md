### FOUNDERS FOUNDERS
#### Role: Community & Operations Manager at Founders Founders

 <br />

#### WHAT IS IT?

[Founders Founders](http://www.founders-founders.com/) is a community of entrepreneurs, companies, investors and an international network of mentors and strategic partners in the areas of management, marketing, technology and communication. It is not an incubator and it is not an accelerator. It is a community of 250 people from all over the world who want to promote individual and business growth through a context that empowers collaboration and mutual aid.

 <br />
#### HOW IT STARTED?

It was founded by 5 entrepreneurs who graduated from another incubator ([UPTEC](https://uptec.up.pt/)) and realised that the city was lacking a place where market-validated fast-growing companies could work together and share experiences. Founders Founders was therefore created to satisfy these needs in 2016 and has been growing ever since.

#### HOW IT FUNCTIONS?

A part of Founders Founders community is installed at the Founders House, community’s physical home. The House is located in the city center of Porto, Portugal in a beautiful office building with more than 1500m2 and is prepared to host more than 18 companies.

In the house there is also the Founders Café, a privileged place where the entrepreneurial community gathers and discusses innovate ideas & precious experiences. Besides that, the Founders Café is the place where all the community events happen - from four official monthly events dedicated to business (Scale Me Up), technology (Tech Tech Talk), networking (Founders Are Happy [Hour]), marketing and sales (Let’s Grow Again) to other one-time events related to entrepreneurial fields (Fireside Chat, Workshops, Storytelling among others).

Currently, Founders Founders houses 16 different start-ups, ([these in particular](http://www.founders-founders.com/residents/) focused on areas such as digital marketing, retail, health & facility management. Together, all the Founding Founders’ resident companies have received more than 5 Million Euros in investment and employ more than 160 people.

#### MY ROLE 
As the community manager of Founders Founders I’m responsible for day-to-day operations of the community ensuring the well-being of all Founders. I manage the organization’s communication, marketing, PR & sponsors, as well as, direct and coordinate activities & events. Besides that, I’m also responsible for the pre-selection, selection and on-boarding of the new resident scale-ups at Founders Founders.

I joined Founders Founders in June 2016 and the project has been growing ever since. When I joined the Founders Founders only had 8 resident start-ups, 80 resident member and around 150 people involved in the community.   

In short we can say I make sure that Founders Founders community provides the best conditions for its members and creates synergies between them to contribute towards their growth, every day.

My work also involves leading and implementing Founders Founders independent projects such as Founders TV’s first vlog series  - Founder Meets Founder, Founders Club and BOOM – Massive Growth Week.

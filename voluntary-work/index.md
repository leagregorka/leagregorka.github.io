### VOLUNTARY WORK
#### Role: Volunteer

 <br />
####  WHAT IS IT?
I currently have 4 different experience as a volunteer in different roles: 
 <br /> •	Assistant of Social worker at [Center of Social Work of Vrhnika](http://www.csd-vrhnika.com/) (Slovenia) 
 <br /> •	Art Therapy Volunteer at [Association Plus5](https://pomoczumetnostjo.blogspot.pt/) Ljubljana (Slovenia) 
 <br /> •	Child-care worker at [Institute Tamala](http://www.prostovoljstvo.org/index.php?t=itemOrganization&uid=3847) (Slovenia)
•	Learning Assistance at [Primary School of Ivan Cankar](http://www.osivanacankarja.si/) (Slovenia) 


#### HOW IT STARTED?
While attending the [Faculty of Social Work](https://www.fsd.uni-lj.si/) we have many time spoke about giving back to the community and the faculty itself also had a very empowering and facilitating attitude towards volunteer work. Since I felt the need to contribute to our society and do some good, I decided to become a volunteer in my first year of bachelor studies. 


#### HOW IT FUNCTIONS?
Each of my four volunteer experiences was independent and was in correlation with in institution that has a specific objective, mission and vision. 

The Center of Social work Vrhnika is a center for  is an academic discipline and profession that concerns itself with individuals, families, groups and communities in an effort to enhance social functioning and overall well-being.[1][2] Social functioning refers to the way in which people perform their social roles, and the structural institutions that are provided to sustain them.[3] Social work applies social sciences, such as sociology, psychology, political science, public health, community development, law, and economics, to engage with client systems, conduct assessments, and develop interventions to solve social and personal problems; and create social change. Social work practice is often divided into micro-work, which involves working directly with individuals or small groups; and macro-work, which involves working communities, and within social policy, to create change on a larger scale.


#### MY ROLE 

The first volunteering experience was the learning assistance and in this role I have helped 2 children with financial disabilities with their learning process. Besides that, I also organised and led educational group games for children at the school. 

While working as the art therapy volunteer I Implemented workshops for people with disabilities, elderly and children using art therapy approaches.

As a child-care worker I practiced childcare (newborn babies and infants)  and also participated in recuperation of Mothers (postpartum depression, emotional reactions on birth, selfesteem). My work at Tamala also cinsisted of a 1-day even  organization for children 
 

As the social worker’s assistant I was responsible to help in supportive counselling (affirming, challenging, encouraging, informing clients). Besides that I also helped enable social services and benefits in the social services department.

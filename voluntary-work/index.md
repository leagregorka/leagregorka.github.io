# VOLUNTARY WORK

## WHAT IS IT?

I currently have 4 different experience as a volunteer in different roles:

- Assistant of Social worker at [Center of Social Work of Vrhnika](http://www.csd-vrhnika.com/) (Slovenia)
- Art Therapy Volunteer at [Association Plus5](https://pomoczumetnostjo.blogspot.pt/) Ljubljana (Slovenia)
- Child-care worker at [Institute Tamala](http://www.prostovoljstvo.org/index.php?t=itemOrganization&uid=3847) (Slovenia)
- Learning Assistance at [Primary School of Ivan Cankar](http://www.osivanacankarja.si/) (Slovenia)


## HOW IT STARTED?

During my stuides at the [Faculty of Social Work](https://www.fsd.uni-lj.si/) we have spoken about giving back to the community many times. The faculty itself had a very empowering and facilitating attitude towards volunteer work. Since I felt the need to contribute to our society and do some good, I decided to become a volunteer in my first year of bachelor studies.

## HOW IT FUNCTIONS?

Each of my four volunteer experiences was independent and took place in different institution that had a specific objective, mission and vision. 

The [Center of Social Work of Vrhnika](http://www.csd-vrhnika.com/) is a public institution that aims to improve social welfare. Its areas of work include: providing social services within the public service network, social assistance (engaging with client systems, conducting assessments and interventions that solve social and personal problems) and social integration.

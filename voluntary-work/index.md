# VOLUNTARY WORK

So far, I've had 4 different volunteering experiences where I had the role of:

- Assistant of Social worker at [Center of Social Work of Vrhnika](http://www.csd-vrhnika.com/) (Slovenia)
- Art Therapy Volunteer at [Association Plus5](https://pomoczumetnostjo.blogspot.pt/) Ljubljana (Slovenia)
- Child-care worker at [Institute Tamala](http://www.prostovoljstvo.org/index.php?t=itemOrganization&uid=3847) (Slovenia)
- Learning Assistance at [Primary School of Ivan Cankar](http://www.osivanacankarja.si/) (Slovenia)


Each of my 4 volunteer experiences was independent and took place in different institution that had a specific objective, mission and vision. 

The [Center of Social Work of Vrhnika](http://www.csd-vrhnika.com/) is a public institution that aims to improve social welfare. Its areas of work include: providing social services within the public service network, social assistance (engaging with client systems, conducting assessments and interventions that solve social problems) and social integration.

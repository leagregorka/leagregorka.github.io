## MY ROLE

During my time with Catapult I've held multiple different role - from Innovation Corrdinator and Delivery Manager to Product Manager. 
In these roles, I've **led and shaped multiple acceleration and R&D programmes** such as: 

- [Augmentor](https://augmentor.digicatapult.org.uk/)
- [CreativeXR](https://creativexr.co.uk/)
- [Audience of the Future](https://audienceofthefuture.live/)
- [Made Smarter](https://www.madesmarter.uk/)

During these initiatives, I've also **helped 50+ tech startups** across a range of sectors **with their growth** - from building an MVP to finding their PM fit and shaping their go-to market stragetgies. This generated stellar results such as a 50% investment rate among startup cohorts I worked with and increased programmes' recognition.

When working on bigger scope projects like Made Smarter, I've handled and managed expectations of commercial clients such as Sainsbury and BAE Systems, as well as worked cross-functionally with teams to create value.

I was also part of the team that lanched the company's first spin-of:

- [Urban Data Collective](https://www.urbandatacollective.com/)

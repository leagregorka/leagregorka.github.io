# DIGITAL CATAPULT

## WHAT IS IT?

[Digital Catapult](https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/) drives early adoption of **artificial intelligence, immersive and future networks technologies** to make UK businesses more competitive and productive, and to **grow the country’s economy**.

At Digital Catapult we bridge the gap between businesses of all sizes, government and academics to unlock new ways of solving real world challenges in the manufacturing and creative industries. We provide physical and digital facilities that would otherwise not be accessible for smaller companies helping to break down barriers to technology adoption.

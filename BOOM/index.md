## HOW IT STARTED?

BOOM is a project that brings together the whole start-up community of Porto –  [ANJE](http://www.anje.pt/), [Founders Founders](www.founders-founders.com), [PDF](https://www.pdf.ipp.pt/),[UPTEC](https://uptec.up.pt/)  & [ScaleUp Porto](scaleupporto.pt/). Founders Founders was and still is the initiator of the project as well as the leader of the event’s organization.

## HOW IT FUNCTIONS?

The event has in total [5 days, 25 workshops and 25 speakers](http://www.theboomweek.com/#schedule). Each day of the week has a  different focus:  day 1 on “Getting the basics right”, day 2 on “Awareness & Education”, day 3 on “Nurturing & Conversion”, day 4 on “Sales Development” and day 5 on “Customer Success & Referrals”. During each day at least 5 different talks with 5 different speakers occur.

Besides that, each day the location of the event changes as well. This way the participants get to know the places and communities of Porto’s start-up ecosystem.

## THE RESULTS

BOOM’s first edition was a success – the participants labelled it as a fantastic event that Porto’s startup community was missing. According to them the event provided them with straightforward and real startup experience as well as with important concepts and practical examples that they can start applying tomorrow. 

The speakers saw the event as extremely valuable and well-constructed in terms of content. Besides that they saw the event as a good opportunity for networking and sharing experiences.

## MY ROLE

Since Founders Founders was the initiatior of this one-week growth boot camp, I had the leading role in its organization. I was responsible for the event from conception to clean up - this means everything from reaching out to the potential co-organizers, scheduling regular meetings with them and also delegation of all events responsabilities (i.e. speakers and partner relations, PR, scout and book locations, food, entertainment, staff and cleanup). 

I created an inspiring vision among co-organizers, motivated and inspired the team to engage with that vision
as well as all the deliveries of that vision. I synchronized the work and made sure that team members were delivering according to the deadlines and objectives that were previsouly defined.

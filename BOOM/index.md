## HOW IT STARTED?

The project was created due to the lack of startup growth initiatives in the Portuguese entrepreneurial ecosytem. The purpose of the event is to share knowledge - the learned lessons, the best practices and the tips - so that the startups can boost their business growth

## MY ROLE

I was the BOOM's lead organizer, which meant I was responsible for the event from its conception to implementation. I reached out to other co-organizers, scheduled and led regular meetings with them and also delegated the events responsabilities (i.e. speakers, partners relations, PR, scout and book locations, food, entertainment, staff and cleanup). 

My main task was to create and maintain an inspiring vision among co-organizers, and also motivate and enage so they would delivers this vision. I synchronized the work and made sure that team members were respecting the deadlines and objectives that we had previsouly defined.

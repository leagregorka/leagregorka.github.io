# MENTORSHIP

I've supported a mentee in achieving their career and business goals as part of LMF Network women in tech cohort . 

[LMF Network](http://www.csd-vrhnika.com/) is a global social Ed tech (not for profit) focused on building confidence, capabilities and careers through workshops, mentoring and community.

Since 2018, they have worked hard to enable women into the workplace. Their efforts have taken them to a community of 50,000+ socially; upskilled 15,000+ people across 24 countries and launched the largest virtual mentoring programme.

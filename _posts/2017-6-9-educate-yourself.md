University of Porto was ranked #301 at the [QS World University Ranking](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2018) 🏅 (and I’m also starting to feel the agony of finishing the writing of my master thesis), so it seemed appropriate to dedicate this newsletter to education.  😉

First things first, I wish we **wouldn’t limit our concept of education with school/university.** 📖

Education is a never-ending process, that begins when you are born and ends when you die. Our schooling system 🏫 is just a temporary formal tool to convey specialized knowledge to our avid young minds. 👦

We often mix these two concepts 🌀 and expect schools to be the only thing needed to get us a successful career. 🏆 Despite the well known fact that some of the most successful people in the planet dropped it…

>“Zuckerberg dropped out of school and look what he has become.”

Yeah, but the great majority of us is not a Mark Zuckerberg (or anything like him, most probably). 🤓 I mean, the guy dropped out of HARVARD – what do you think got him there? 💡 Besides that, he quit to pursue a higher goal, completing his project (Facebook).

>“My degree has nothing to do with my current job.” 📜

True in many cases! However, did you ever question how you got to be where you are now?

Our reasons, actions, context, and history (including our formal education) matter.📍 You as a person are defined by all of them. 💪

That’s why you are at your current job. That’s why Mark dropped out.

**The base premise of education is progress. 🌱  Improve yourself and change your current path if you need to.** As an entrepreneur, as a student or even as a person. 😜

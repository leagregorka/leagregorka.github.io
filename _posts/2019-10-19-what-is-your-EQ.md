“There’s no room 🚫 for emotions at a workplace.”

Couldn’t disagree more with this statement. ☝️ The presence of emotions at a workplace is inevitable (well, unless you’re a robot 🤖).

Even more, during the course of our professional relationships we experience a wide range of emotions. 🌀 These even intensify, if we love what we do. 💗

Instead of suppressing and avoiding feelings, which will BTW only lead to harming ourselves and others 🤕, we should focus on managing them in a proper way. 👍

We should be what some call “emotionally intelligent”,🕴️which just means we are capable of understating and handling our emotions properly. 🎛️

So for example, when facing a frustrating work situation such as performance criticism where we’ll likely experience unpleasant emotions, we shouldn’t take them out on others 🗯️ or take them personally. 💢

We should observe and analyse these emotions, 🤔 and not consider the situation as a personal attack on us, but rather as an opportunity to use these emotions to motivate ourselves to deliver a better work. 💪 However, if something does upset us legitimately, we should have a private conversation 🗣️with the other person or the team about it. 🤝*

You can have some of these emotional skills more naturally and others not. But they are all skills, meaning that if we wish to master it 💎 – we ought to learn & practice them. 😉



*I’m not considering real personal attacks. In these cases we should take appropriate action to defend ourselves. ❗

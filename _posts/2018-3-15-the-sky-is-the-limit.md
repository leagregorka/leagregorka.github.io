As all of you know, Stephen Hawking 🙌past away this week. ⚰

What can we learn from this brilliant mastermind besides his fascinating scientific theories?

- Courage 💪– Stephan courageously faced his illness, even though it was scary, uncertain and deadly. So, do what frightens you. Dare!
- Curiosity 🕵 – He relentlessly kept looking for answers. Gained new knowledge. Try to wonder about life & the the things arround you. Maybe not at “Stephen Hawking” level, but do your best.
- Determination ❗- In spite of all the obstacles and holdbacks Hawking never gave up. You shouldn’t too. Decide to do something & stick to it.
- Humour 😂– This was Hawking’s secret to overcoming his illness. Laugh & maintain your sense of humour in order to stay healthy emotionally.

But the most important thing he taught & showed us is his incredible positivity. 😁 No matter how difficult your life may seem 🌀, you have countless opportunities to make it better & succeed at it. Stephen faced his limitations 🚫& converted them into advantages. He literally said that because of his disabilities he actually got more time to think about the universe than a person without it. 🔼

His positive attitude ➕ lead to positive outcomes. 👍

What is your excuse? 🧐

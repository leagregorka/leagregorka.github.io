Every now and then operational and behavioural challenges ❓ arise in our packed Founders House which is considered like a second home to over 160 people. 🏠

How would one usually solve them? 🤔 By implementing rules right? 📝 Rules like we have at home, in school or in society for example. Although these are essential so we can all co-exist without hurting each other and enforce rights, ☮ we decided to do a bit more than just impose rules per-se to solve our community challenges. 😄

Why? Well A – because having rules doesn’t automatically mean that people will also respect them. 😅  And B – because Founders Founders isn’t a formal institution and although we could probably achieve something with rules, bosses and processes, we won’t. 🚫 That’s the opposite of what we want and who we are. 😉

So how do we reach common ground? By shaping a specific community culture that shares a set of values and behaviours. 💗

But beware, we create and define this Founders Founders status quo together with the residents. 👥👥  Each resident contributes and forms 💪 the community spirit and guidelines. This strategy aligns the aspects between us 🎛 and makes the culture more meaningful to the residents.💖

Since the culture is all about having the right attitude and relationships, 🔗 our strategy was and still is to tackle it at its core – each individual. 🚹

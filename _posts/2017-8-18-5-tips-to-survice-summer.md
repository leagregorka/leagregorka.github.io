I’m currently on vacations, I’m discovering the shores of the Algarve region 🏖  followed by a nice visit to my mother land, Slovenia 🇸🇮  (highly recommend a visit if you haven’t yet).

But since I assume not everybody has the luck of taking a few days off, I won’t be sharing photos to make you even more frustrated. 😜 Instead, I prepared a list of 5⃣  things that can help you (as they helped me) stay focused while working during summer holiday times:

**Think about higher purpose 👁‍🗨**

Probably you have a reason why you are working right now. Either you need the money or you just need to finish everything up to go on holidays. Maybe right now you just cannot take time off because you are building up your next big business idea. Either way something better lies ahead of you. Use that as a motivator.

**Make the most of your time ⏰**

Try to do more in less time. You’ll be free for your personal life sooner.

**You are working but do not forget to relax 😎**

This can mean leaving earlier some days (if you can), have a pause, have a drink with someone, reorganize your schedule. Anything that keeps your spirits up. You’ll be more productive after!

**Empower to be empowered 💪**

Encourage people around you to do more, delegate work. By empowering your team you will be rewarded with better work and more time to focus on what really matters to you.

When feeling sleepy or caught yourself daydreaming, **energise yourself 🔝**  – Stop, stand up, go take a coffee or black tea, exercise, sing, etc. Get pumped up!

That’s it. No rocket science, just a few tips to help you stay on track. 😉

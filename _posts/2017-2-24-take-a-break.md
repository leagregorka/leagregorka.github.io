Today we’re doing something different – please do as I say (bear with me) 🙏:

Slowly & deeply breath in … & breath out … 🌬(you aren’t doing it! C’mon, do it for real 😉) Long inhale …& longer exhale … Repeat it … continue with the same breathing pace while gently straightening your spine and feeling how the tension from your shoulders is releasing.

There you go. We’re all done. 👍 Probably you are wondering why we did this – well because this a 24/7/365 hustle & running around can be overwhelming sometimes 😩! It is important to take a pause ⏸ & just distance yourself from the daily chaos.

Put some music on, dance, read, do yoga, run, sleep, yell, cook, meditate… Whatever the activity, as long as it makes you unwind & recharge. 🔋

These short moments of disconnection will have marvellous consequences – you will get focused easier, your mood will improve, you will control your stress levels. In short, they will improve your overall mental & physical health. ✌

**GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK!**

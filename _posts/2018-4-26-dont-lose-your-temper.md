Ever been angry? 😡 I sure have. 😁 For that reason, I wish to share a story that was told to me when I was little that may show us a different perspective and rethink our anger. 😉

“Once upon a time there was a boy 👦 who had a bad temper. His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, 👨‍👦 he must hammer a nail into the fence. 🔨

The first day the boy nailed 40 nails into the fence, the next day 35, the day afterwards 30. With time the boy discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence. 😩 Eventually the number of nails hammered daily, lowered down to 0.

The boy told his father about it and the father suggested that now he pulls out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. ⌛

The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said “you have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. ⛔ When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one.”

Learn to control your temper. ☝Otherwise it may cost you your job, clients or even blow up your personal or work relationships.

Don’t let your temper destroy your future. 😃 Think 🤔 before you speak & act. 😜

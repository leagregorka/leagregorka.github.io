This week we took advantage of the nice weather and went on a 3h philosophical retreat  💭  with the founding members of Founders Founders 😀 (check us out 📷).

{% include figure.html url="/assets/images/posts/retreat.jpg" description="" %}

We wanted to take some time to brainstorm ⚡ over what happened on the last few months and sync our expectations for the future. 🔮  Usually this kind of meetings happen at the end of the year, but we like to do things our way, so why not in the middle of August?

**Well, no matter the timing, these meetings to brainstorm and plan are golden. 🏅  Not only for us but also for all start-ups, companies or people even. They help us align our visions and design clear objectives to which we can all compromise to achieve. 🎯**

Defining and planning the execution of these goals maximizes our effectiveness and minimizes uncertainty when we go ahead to execute them. 📈  It gives us a sense of direction and a better control of the whole process. ⬆

Similarly, the appreciation of the past and the evolution that we already have undergone, empowers us.💪 But at the same time also reminds us to look forward for some more awesomeness ahead! 😉

FYI – Next week we won’t keep you entertained. ⚠  Our community will partially enter in recharging mode. Try not to miss us too much!

Finally my parents came to visit me here in Portugal! 🇵🇹 😜

Well, besides being happy 🙃 & letting myself be spoiled (hey, I deserve it 😊), it has made me realize something – we are an average of the people that surround us. 👥

Whoever they are, they define us as people and inevitably influence our future. Personally and professionally.👂

So be careful who you choose! Surround yourself with people who support and believe in you, lifting up your spirits when you most need it. Positivity is contagious! ➕

If you indeed are an average of the people that surround you, choose people that exceed you in the things you are worse at so that you can complete yourself.💡 This way you’ll manage to continuously improve yourself.

Your time is also an investment – it needs to generate a return at some point. So dedicate your time to the ones that are worth your investment! 😎

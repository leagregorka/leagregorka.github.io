What do you do when things do not go as planned? ⛔

Honestly, a few years ago I was that person that would enter panic 😱 mode if things went south.  I believe my Germanic/Slavic vain had something to do with that. 😁

But with time things changed. ⌛ I’ve learned over the years that panicking doesn’t bring anything positive, it can actually provoque harm, so I slowly trained myself into a different mentality and behaviour specifically for these critical situations. 😌 I believe the unpredictable start-up environment and Portuguese carefree mind-set are responsible for that. 😆

So how do I react now?
Firstly, I always try not to get upset. 🆒 I acknowledge the situation, but I’m not hard on myself or others, because it is pointless to be hard. I try to enter a proactive mode instead of a dwelling one. 🚧  I think about alternatives.🤔 What can be done 💡  instead and what was the cause for something to have happened. 🔀 I ask others for help. And then I decide on how to proceed. ✅

It’s all about adapting. Changing what we can, to still get the wanted result or attain objectives. 🎯 The better we get at coping with these changes and un/controlled circumstances the more flexible we are. 😉 The more ready we are to face anything. 💪

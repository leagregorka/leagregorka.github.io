Since many startups of our community are looking for new team members 👥(Bitmaker, Infraspeak, TonicApp) I decided to explore their hiring processes & share them with you (they might come in handy to you). 😉

So how do our start-ups’ HR departments (aka the founders themselves) tackle hiring? 🤔 They

- Reach out to their networks for potential candidates 🌐 (& their team member’s network) – personal referrals are far more valuable than any CV application send ⚖
- Involve their team in the process – employee’s contributions about what are the real needs in the team are valuable 💪 (+ they also help in the selection process)
- Put job ads on their websites (& other related websites) ℹ – here, writing an appealing & clear job description is a must (tell exactly what you want -like in THIS example)
- Pre-evaluating candidates’ skills through CV  revisions, past experiences or challenges 🔍 – like solving a tech/content/sale task – everything to avoid wasting time
- Schedule & implement intense interviews with the the top 5 (max.) final choices ☝ – here they try to meet the candidate from their professional and personal perspectives to assess a team fit ✅
- For the final choice they go with their “gut” feeling 💚 – they opt for the person that “feels” like the best fit
- Over all, they take their time & try not to force the hire. It might take time to find the perfect fit, but once they appear it pays off long-term-wise. 👌Great employees attract great employees. 🔝

Remember, each new hire for the start-ups is crucial, especially in the early beginning❗ You are also building your start-up culture & identity, so for that reason I believe the candidates’ personality, soft skills are equally ♨ (if not more) important as the technical one.

I mean, on the long-term one can learn the required technical skills, but many times the same person cannot become a culture fit to be a good team member.💔

How about you? What’s your hiring strategy❓

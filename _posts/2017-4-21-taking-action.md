This week was packed with exiting events at F2 and you know what happened? I got sickâ€¦. ðŸ¤§

Even though I tried my best to fight the cold & fever (yep Iâ€™m one of those lunatics who goes to the office & gets others infected too ðŸ‘¿), I had to admit my defeat on Tuesday.

When I was about to sob of despair in my bed, I came to the conclusion that itâ€™s pointless. The fact was, I couldnâ€™t work even if I wanted to. So I did what was best for me in that moment, rest! ðŸ›Œ

This principle of accepting the uncontrollable circumstances (sickness) and then acting upon them (resting) accordingly to your goals (getting better) is applicable to every situation in our life. ðŸ’¯

This means that you should accept the fact âœ… that you need at least 6 hours of sleep, that you will receive 100 emails in your inbox today, that you already have 40 unanswered calls & constant client request, etc.

So, prioritise the endless tasks in your start-up. Balance your pipeline activities. Orientate your team towards revenue. Check emails only once a day. Etc.ðŸ˜Ž

Forcing yourself to go against the uncontrollable or doing everything at the same time, wontâ€™ get you there. Youâ€™ll just be less productive and more stressed. ðŸš«

Work with what was given to you & become a master at managing your flood of daily tasks. ðŸ’ª This way youâ€™ll be always unstoppable (even with a cold). ðŸ˜œ

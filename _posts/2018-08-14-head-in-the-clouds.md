Imagination 🔮 is extremely valuable, but often not appreciated enough. Einstein even said that, imagination is more important than knowledge. ☝️

I share a similar opinion. 😃 Knowledge can have an inhibitory effect sometimes. 🛑

Usually we limit ourselves to the understandable. 📚 To the already learned, tested and discovered. 🎓 To the experience. 🧐

With imagination we go beyond that. 🔝 Instead of following the same course of known problem-solutions, we envision other infinite possibilities and new ideas. ✨ We become creative.

Imagination isn’t bound to any experiences, aspirations or area. 🔀 Each one of us has imagination abilities and the potential to use it anywhere. 👥 And since imagination stimulates innovation, it’s certainly a recommended and useful perk in entrepreneurship. 👍

Imagination also shapes how we see and perceive reality. 🕶️ So, let yourself have your head amongst the clouds every once in a while. 🌥️ Sometimes we need to escape our everyday life 🙃 to be able to start producing greater and (what seems to be) impossible things.  😉

When was the last time you’ve brighten someone’s day? 🤔

This week a community member certainly made mine. 😊 The simple gesture of giving me some adorable stickers 🏷️ has lifted my spirits completely. 📈Afterwards I amusingly started sticking them on my belongings. What a thrill. 😄

So, what’s my point here? Sometimes we go into robot mode 🤖 and we become so caught up into our daily tasks and focused on their execution 🌀 that we forget about other people around us and the things that really matter. What I mean is that entrepreneurial, densely packed schedules and long working hours 😓 could get a lot easier 😃 if we would all try to do make someone’s day by doing something thoughtful and unexpected. 👍

It might seem silly, 🙃 but in the end it’s really all about the journey. Making a kind gesture ✨ will trigger your laugh & make you feel less stressed. Likewise for the target of your kind gesture – it’s the snowball effect of positive attitudes. 🔄

So, make a difference. Make someone’s day TODAY! 😉

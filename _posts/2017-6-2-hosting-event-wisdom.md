It seemed almost inevitable to write about yesterday’s amazing event at our House, but since I already glorified it 🌟(with reason❗) last week, I decided not to repeat myself.

However, I’ll share the advices that Carlos and Paulo gave for future entrepreneurs. 😎 👍

Bottom line is, you and your product shouldn’t stay in a hiding cocoon. Although it is a safe and isolated zone, you need to escape from it. ☄

Whether a founder or a start-up, cut your way out of the cocoon ✂ – be opened, speak with people, ask them for help, don’t be afraid to show your product. If your idea is to fail, better for it to fail faster than later.

**Illusion of safety 🌀 inside a cocoon is more dangerous than the rough reality.** If you realize you are heading for a failure, 🆘  you can pivot earlier and avoid failure altogether.

Focus on your market and not in your technology/product. 🗺 If you listen to your market, you will end up building the perfect fit product for them in the end anyway. 🔗

**And remember, there is no universal path for success. You need to walk your walk. 😉**

In chemistry, a catalyst is an agent that is added to a process in order to speed up a reaction.💨  In a broader sense, a catalyst is a thing or a person that causes or facilitates change. 🔄

If we adapt this concept to the entrepreneurial environment, we can say that a start-up catalyst is someone that takes y/our product/service to the next level. 🔝

Someone who is engaged, motivated and confident enough to dare to get things done 💪 and get them done exceptionally. 🌟 It’s that someone who takes initiative and doesn’t just wait for tasks.

With a catalyst it’s easier to reach the desired goals. ✅ Get more done with less. 📈 Have a source of positive mind-set. 😃

All the (great) founders are catalysts a priori. 🚼 And ideally all the company’s employees are, in a certain way, as well. 👥👥

What about you – are you a catalyst too? 😀

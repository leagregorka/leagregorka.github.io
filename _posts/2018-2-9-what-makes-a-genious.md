Yesterday was our cultural day in Slovenia, 🇸🇮 called “Prešeren Day”. What does that even mean?

Well, in short the holiday is a celebration of Slovenian’s greatest poet ever, ✍France Prešeren (so great even our anthem includes a part of his work 🎶 ). Do not worry, I won’t be preaching you on Slovenian literature. 📚 Instead I wish to share my fascination over these people that manage to leave a mark on our histories.🎖

I mean, how unbelievable is the fact that even 200 years after your death you’re still remembered. 🤩 That people still know your name, your work & appreciate it. 🔝

It’s remarkable. What kind of person achieves such greatness? 💡

Genius individuals with exceptional talent? 💎 Hard workers that train & always seek for solutions?💪 Great intellectuals? 🧐  Creative people with rich imagination? 🌀 How does someone stand out like that? 🔥 Well, it’s a combination of a lot these factors most probably. Whatever the area of expertise.

If I look at Prešeren’s case, he, despite his unhappy life, unfulfilled love 💔 & heavy drinking problem 🍷, managed to produce outstanding poetry (or maybe he produced because of it? 😂 ). So, there’s no excuse. We can still leave our marks & make the generations after celebrate our achievements.😉

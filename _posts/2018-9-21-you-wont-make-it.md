Ever had to cancel an already accepted invitation to an event? ❌ Quite an unpleasant thing to do, or, to hear if you were the inviter. 😒

We should be cautious and considerate about how we do the cancelling.  ⚠️

Why? Well, we were the ones that agreed and vowed 🤝 to spend time with that particular person at that place and time, when we accepted the invitation. ✅ We made a commitment. That’s different than saying no or than not saying anything at all.

So how to communicate we won’t make it? 😃

First, we better have an actual good reason for the cancellation. If we’re just cancelling because we don’t feel like going, that’s just rude and pretentious. 🤥 We should reconsider our decision and consequences, 💭 but most definitely get our priorities straight next time.

However, if we sincerely cannot attend because something came up 🚨(e.g. other responsibilities, longer previous meetings), we should communicate the reason(s) why as soon as we know that we won’t make it. 🗣️ People are comprehensive if we inform in advance or if something unexpected and uncontrollable happens (e.g. car crash).

There are also different ways to communicate our reasons. 🔀 We can either apologise, explain ourselves or even suggest an alternative. Or not. I’d personally go for polite, up front, direct and genuine. 😉 Nobody likes fishy excuses. Whether it’s through email, call or text.

That’s it. Basic and obvious, but effective. 👍 Don’t be that person that cancels 10 minutes before the even, or worse, not even bothers to cancel.

Be respectful and thoughtful with others. 😀 That’s what professionalism is all about.

This week we hosted an event of GovTech, a governmental initiative 🇵🇹 that aims to support innovative products/services that address the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 🎯 of United Nations (these HERE). 🌐

Being a sustainable business means that it has minimal negative impact on the 🗺global or local environment, community, society, or economy 😁—a business that strives to meet the triple bottom line. Often, sustainable businesses have progressive environmental and human rights policies. ℹ

Did you know that there is a word that links entrepreneurship and innovation for sustainability – Sustainopreneurship? 🤩 Well, Sustainopreneurship is all about using business in creative ways and turning world problems into business opportunities. 🔝

Having a business idea that aims to be sustainable in this sense, brings a lot of perks. Here are some: 😎

- It contributes towards a stronger brand purpose. ⭐ Positive reputation = competitive advantage.
- It increases employee satisfaction 😀 since they are working for something that really matters.
- It disrupts corporate’s organization or at least makes them re-think it. ⁉
- It creates a legacy. 📜 You’ll be leaving behind something impactful for the following generations and making a positive footprint on the planet. ⌛

But above all sustainability is all about contributing towards a better tomorrow.  🌍So, think, plan, act and innovate. 😉 Make a difference!  💪

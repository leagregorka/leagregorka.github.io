It’s Friday the 13th 😨 – whoa!

{% include figure.html url="/assets/images/posts/friday-13.png" description="" %}

Well… don’t freak out! 👻😱

🤔 Firstly, a quick (& the most probable) explanation of how the whole phobia has arisen: Friday – the day of Christ’s crucifixion, 13 – individuals were present at the Last supper. Mix these two things together – hell no, nothing good can come out of it right?

All superstitions & assumptions aside, there is actually no evidence that Friday or the number 13 are unlucky. However, quite ironically, there is a very strong evidence of the fear of Friday the 13th – great business losses (we´re talking 800 or $900 million here). 💸💸

If you, by any chance, suffer from “paraskevidekatriaphobia” aka The fear of Friday the 13th, we are deeply sorry – just try to get through the day by doing something unusual (like dropping by at our House 😉).

We don’t mind the date, especially since we are in boost mode thanks to our ♥ Founders Happy Hour ♥ that lifted up our energies.👏👏

So 0 panic & stress, everything is gonna be alright. If anything is happening, it’s our TECH week! 😁

Stay lucky!

What’s the best way to tackle naming of a product/company/brand/event/etc.❓ Is there a magic formula? 🔮  Is there an easy way to do it?

I have found many tips that can help us find the right name – From acronyms, removing & adding an extra letter 🔡  to trying to spice thing us by using foreign words or symbols 🔣. How about just naming it after yourself or a random place in the world📍 or dictionary 📚 ? Or finding inspiration in literature, arts or even drugs (yes, strong Pied Piper reference 🤣).

Although these ideas can be useful 👍 , I believe each naming process should be unique because your product/company will also be unique (no universal receipt 🙃).

So don’t push the process. Give it time. ⏳ Know what message & image you want to convey through your name to your target clients. 🔭 Have a clear vision – the more specific, the better.

Be original & check for legal restrictions.👩‍⚖️ Think about your clients & target audience. 🎯 Involve people in this process – Ideas, feedback or different points of view are always a plus. 💬

Simple rather than complex. 🌀 That should be the objective.

Choose wisely! 🧐  💡

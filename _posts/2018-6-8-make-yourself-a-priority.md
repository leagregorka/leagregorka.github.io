When you are creating something completely 🆕 or pursuing an unusual idea as an entrepreneur, you receive countless different reactions from people around you. 💬 Some motivate you to continue your project, 🔝 others will not share your beliefs. 👎 The latter tend to be more common when you go for something “outside the box”. 😁

Don’t listen to the nay sayers. ⛔ Most people will not be able to see ahead and visualize what your project will be like. 🤔 Change is not always immediately welcomed, ⚖  but then, sometimes it really becomes a new standard in our day to day lives. 👍

Remember this: for everything we use today and regard as essencial, there was one day one visionary believing in it 🔮 and everyone around him thinking he was crazy. 🤪 Pursue your mission no matter what and stand for what you believe for. 😉

Be bold, rebellious & extraordinary. 😜 Don’t mind being regarded as crazy as long as you are fighting for what you believe. Reasonable people don’t change the world. 🌍

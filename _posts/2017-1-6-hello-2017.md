2017 has arrived! For some, the arrival of a new year represents the time for fresh starts or big changes, for others it doesnâ€™t have any special meaning â€“ itâ€™s just another year.

Well, at F2, we relate to the scientific perspective of the new year â€“ Thatâ€™s why for us the new year of 2017 will be another amazing journey (like the earthâ€™s one around the sun is) among many on our travelling agenda. However, this particular journey is going to be something special â€“ we chose to push our boundaries further more â€“ start new amazing projects, learn new life lessons & also meet new remarkable people along the way!


Letâ€™s exceed our 2016â€™s journey:

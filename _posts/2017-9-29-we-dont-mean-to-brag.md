Today will be a day for bragging. 😁

Founders Founders was listed on the Portuguese network of incubators (RNI). 🙌 We, alongside 130 other companies, were considered as one of the best places for companies to grow! 🌱

Pretty 🆒, I know, but it doesn’t stop there. We even got a special spotlight on the [Exame](https://visao.sapo.pt/exame/2017-09-28-Os-melhores-sitios-para-fazer-nascer-empresas-em-Portugal)’s magazine where we were mentioned as a unique initiative. 💎 What is so special about us, you ask? Well, the fact that Founders Founders was built from founders for founders, 👥 allows us to understand first-handedly the struggles that are faced by entrepreneurs and start-ups while they “walk their walk”. 🚶 From here on, we can address the problems even better and look for solutions and facilitators along the way. 🔧

And another side curiosity note – the article also refers that the start-ups’ rate of failure is doubled outside of incubators. ⏬ Amazing how, when we are together we can face greater challenges, easier. 💪

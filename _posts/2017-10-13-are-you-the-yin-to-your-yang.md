Did you know that around 50% of companies have more than 1 founder? 🤔

For employees, many times, this means that they will have to deal with several “bosses”. 👥 In these situations, it is of the utmost importance that the founders are in syntony. ✅

The co-founders are to the employees, like parents are to their children. This means that employees are looking at them for guidance and support 💪, and this kind of support demands stability, coherence and unity. ⚖

Sometimes, for these co-founder relationships to work, things need to be worked out by them, many times in extra hours ⏱, even outside of the workplace. If this does not happen, divergences will occur in front of the employees. 🌀 This will inevitably lead to confusion, unproductivity and uncomfortable situations. 😵

Make sure, you’re truly the “yin” to the “yang” of your co-founders. ☯

In the previous newsletter I have already shared with you the big news 🔊  – **the launch of an initiative called FoundersTV**.

Its first ever production consist of 1 season of a special kind of talk show, Founder Meets Founder. 😎

Well, this week the F2 community witnessed a filming marathon of 5 episodes of this talk show. 📽  Needless to say we had a blast throughout the whole day and we cannot wait to see the final results. 🎉 👍

But that’s not all. The first episode that was filmed in the beginning of June is almost ready to be published (just 2 more weeks)! 😃

But meanwhile, to quench your thirst🚰, I want to share this sneak peek with you. ⬇

Hope you enjoy it as much as we do. 😉

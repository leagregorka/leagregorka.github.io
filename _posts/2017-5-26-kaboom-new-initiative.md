This week’s weather brought us the sun ☀ and good summer vibes 🏖, so it seemed like the perfect timing to announce our newest surprise! 💥

In case you haven’t heard of it yet – Drum roll please 🥁

We are launching a unique and original initiative for Portuguese Entrepreneurial panorama, the **Founders TV**! 📺

And our first masterpiece will be a special sort of talk show: “**Founder Meets Founder**”. 🎤

This talk show will be an informal meet-up where two of Porto’s well-known entrepreneurs will discuss 💬 the lessons learnt and challenges that their startups have already faced. Live. Face to face. 👥  With no moderation.

Yep, we know, pretty awesome. 😎 Lots of good stuff ahead of us. Join us, next Thursday at 2PM!

Psst, I’m going to let you in another secret: we’ll have Carlos (HypeLabs) and Paulo (ShiftForward) in our 1st edition! 😉

One of the F2 Community’s habits is to organize & promote Founders Council Meetings on a regular basis and this week it was time for a new edition. 😎

The Founders Council Meeting is a gathering of the resident startup CEO’s where current and future decisions about the community are discussed.🎙

Although we all share common interests in the community, sometimes opinions clash. That is why it’s important to keep hearing feedback to make sure we are all rowing in the same direction.

All in all, we are walking this path together with the members, so it is only logical to take decisions that serve the best interests of the community and its members. 🤝

Well, the result of this Founders Council edition was a productive one. We managed to agree on the next steps that we will be taking together in the near future. Stay tuned!

Community power FTW! 💪

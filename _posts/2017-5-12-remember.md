My free time this week was dedicated to converting old photos 📷  and some VHS videos to digital. 📼

While I was passing through these memories a nostalgic feeling started to simmer inside of me. 😊 I guess it happens to all of us from time to time. Even in a professional context.

Remember yourself a few years ago? Your fist job? The crazy business idea you had with no clue about what entrepreneurship meant. The non-believers saying “stick to your regular job”. 🆘

Oh the challenges, the mistakes, the fails, the successes.

All these flashbacks of our history that define us. 🌀 I salute the good ones and laugh at the bad ones. I embrace them all because they make me who I am now.

So, go there, be nostalgic & remind yourself of the path you already walked and what you have accomplished so far. 💎

Keep walking the walk. 👣 And don’t forget to congratulate yourself, you rock! 🤘

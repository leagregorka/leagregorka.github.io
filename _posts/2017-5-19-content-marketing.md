This week’s [talk on Content Marketing for Growth](https://www.facebook.com/foundersfounders/videos/1854162841513532/) was so great I decided to make a summary of the best tips that were passed.📝

Relax, I’m not going to give you a lecture, I just thought that these tips (that I’ll use myself) could also be useful to you. In case you’re a guru already, just skip this part. 😉

So, here it goes:

*  **Stay in touch** aka produce content on a regular basis 📅

*  Audience **adaptation** 👥 – Always consider the who and why

*  Use **visuals** to your advantage 👓

*  **Blend**! 🔁  Connect pertinent content for your audience with your product

*  **Analyse & Experiment** 📊 – Try new things always measuring its magic!

*  **Persona** matters, so let that alter-ego shine 👑

*  **Aggregate** your **content**! Be resourceful, join the existing info you have and make something (e-book/manual/etc) out of it 📒

*  **Originality**🤘– Get creative & do the never yet done!

*  Provoke **engagement**! Make call to actions according to your audience! 🔥

That’s it! Good luck! 😊

[Cristina Fonseca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristinanfonseca/) ([Talkdesk](https://www.talkdesk.com/) co-founder) visited Founders Founders this week & gave an interesting talk (& office hours) to the community. 🆒

In short – it was amazing. 👌  You know how some people just captivate your interest, right away when they start to speak? This was clearly the case.

When I was thinking about why we all stayed that impressed so easily, it hit me. It’s the power of storytelling. 🔊

Cristina just told us her story. She told it in a simple, direct, genuine & truthful manner, allowing the audience to perceive her as a regular person that managed to follow her dreams.

You can use storytelling to pass your ideas or even to sell a product & if you have difficulties in doing this naturally you can always use the help of some tricks that are commonly used (check [here](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240272) for some tips). 😜

And if you top off a good story with great public speaking capabilities, you end up with a very powerful tool to influence and help others. 🤓

With time, details will fade, but not the feeling you convey on your talk. It’s all about this lasting positive effect that you can create on others.➕

**Share your awesome stories & create new ones!**

I challenge you to try this at our monthly events! 😎

How do you envision your future? 🔮 What about your company’s future? What do you imagine it will be? 🤔

It’s incredibly important to see the big picture. Who we want to be. What we want our company to be. What we wish to be known for. 💭

It gives us purpose. It justifies our why’s. 👍

But in order to attain our vision we need to focus on taking steps towards it, not only thinking about the big picture. 🖼 If we only see the big picture, we can risk freezing without knowing where to begin. ❄

How do we overcome this? By setting goals with a neat timeline. 🎯 Carefully thought through. Long, middle and short-term ones. ⏳

These goals will then guide us, keeping us focused on the now, never loosing grip of the dream. We will be directing energy on what really matters (hopefully 😁) and know which distractions to eliminate. 😜

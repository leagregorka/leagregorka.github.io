Did you ever speak with someone 🗣️ and they nodded their head but you knew that they were not really listening to you? 👂

As if they were there physically, but not mentally.  💭

That’s because listening is a conscious decision. A decision that requires one to focus and pay attention to what the speaker is saying. ⚠️ When we’re actively listening we analyse what was said and try to understand it. ✅

But generally we don’t listen or we don’t give our due attention. 🙉

When we listen with the intention to understand it means we assume that what the speaker is saying is true. 🙂 And most of the times we want to be right (specially in arguments), ☝️ so we filter out that what we do not agree with. 🤫

Like this we deliberately choose not to listen to opposite views. 🚫

For start-ups this behaviour could be fatal. 👎  If they don’t listen to their (potential) customers, 🎧 they will never be able to create a solution that sells. Even if their product or service is brilliant and spectacular, it is worthless if it doesn’t meet the needs of the buyer.

Have a clear understanding of your customer demands. 👌 Listen to what they have to say, 🔊 even if you don’t want to. Especially if you don’t want to. 😃

Preparation is so often overlooked. 🙈 Yet it’s the first step towards effective results. 📈

Look at any athlete. 🏋️ Or a musician. 🎼 Or a parent. 🚼

Although we could prepare ourselves to almost any personal and professional endeavour, we generally don’t do it. ⏸️

And I noticed we’re especially sloppy when it comes to meetings. 👥  In a quest for perspective change and a future of productive meetings, 💪 I believe we all should consider & answer these 5 questions before entering any meeting. 

- Why am I having this meeting? 💡
- What do I wish to accomplish? 🔀
- Who am I meeting with and what is their standpoint? 👤
- What is the agenda and how much time will be dedicated to each topic ⏱️(hello time slots)? 😄
- Is there any documentation that I’ll need? 📑

This preparation will take time & energy, but result wise it will pay off. 🙌  With this we’ll understand better our needs, strengths, weaknesses and the leverages to achieve our goals. 🎯 We pass from reactive attitudes to proactive. ✅

Prepare ahead. 😉 The way a parent cannot forget a diaper for his baby 🚸 or a musician his notes 🎶 you shouldn’t disregard your meetings. 😄

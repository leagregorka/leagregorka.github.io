# FOUNDERS CLUB

##  WHAT IS IT?
Founders Club is an **exclusive invite-only membership group of experienced founders** who are invited to share expertise, ask for help and provide contacts at the club's monthly gatherings.

## HOW IT STARTED?
Since there are too many events to attend nowadays and and since everyone is focused on their personal and professional objectives, the **networking quality** is dropping faster than a speeding ticket. Founders Club is a project that was created by Founders Founders to solve exactly that problem.

## HOW IT FUNCTIONS?

The main purpose of the Clubâ€™s exclusivity is to grant the feeling of trust among the members, so they can share their most private and professional problems. For that reason, a **rigorous selection process** is always applied and **only certain individuals are selected**. Only the members whose life experience would be a great asset to other Founders Club members and who would love to learn from others are accepted.

Club members are united on monthly basis at **exclusive dinners with special activities** (e.g. karting, wine tasting) and also on **other occasional events** (weekend retreats, travels, etc.).


## MY ROLE

I was the Founders Club **promoter and organizer**, which meant I was responsible for **all club's operations**. Therefore, I was in charge of the club's **activities, benefits, current and future members**. The majority of my work consisted of coordinating the activities - from the idea phase, scheduling,  inviting to the alignment of members' availabilities.
